Hey there! I'm Botty, let me be the first to welcome you to the Riot API Discord :)

First and foremost: **This is not a helpdesk. We cannot ban or unban any Riot Games account. We cannot buff or nerf any champion. We cannot help you with technical issues in your game.** The Rioters here *do not work on the games*. If you have problems with League of Legends or Teamfight Tactics, please contact support. https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us

Here's some tips to help you on your way:
1. Be sure to read the rules! #rules-faq
2. If you have any questions about the Riot API for LoL, I recommend you post them in #lol-dev, or for TFT or LoR, in #tft-dev or #lor-dev. Please don't ask if you can ask a question, just ask it! If someone knows the answer, they will respond, while "Can I ask a question?" will rarely be replied to.
3. If your English is not that great, you can ask a translator, which have yellow names. Feel free to mention them with `@Translator <your language>`.
4. The pins in the Riot API channel might hold some resources that are not on DDragon. If they're not in the pins, be sure to check out CommunityDragon; https://www.communitydragon.org/
5. I can help you find issues in your url, and also show you the results. Just paste any Riot API url and I will work my magic. Make sure that your key is not in the URL!
6. You can check the status of the API with `!status`.
7. Even though Riot Games doesn't endorse any libraries, we want you to be able to contact the developers of libraries, if available. For example, you can mention the Cassiopeia devs with `@Cassiopeia devs`.

The commands I have right now are:
