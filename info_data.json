Whereas, all users agree to it being pull-able in all other official games. While a normal game isn't try-hard like ranked, the user is still probably playing with the goal to win or compete in the game as intended. This may not always be the case in a custom mode.\n\nThe tournament system also takes into account a user's agreement, as the user is choosing to participate in an official game (the tournament system) and therefore giving some consent on data pulling for those specific games by using the tournament API.\n\nThe shining light to this, is that Riot is slowly but surely working towards an external RSO (Riot Sign-On) solution. Meaning, we as developers, can have users authenticate into Riot (officially) via the API. Which if all goes all, means a user could potentially give us their consent to go view their custom game data or champion mastery grades, etc.. but you would probably need consent per user to do these special calls, versus a blanket policy of letting developers go retrieve more private information.",
