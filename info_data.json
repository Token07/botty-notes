You can see your method limits by going to the developer portal and going to your apps page.\nAs noted above your method limit may be above your application limit, you still need to respect the application limit.\nIt is per endpoint this means ``/riot/account/v1/accounts/by-puuid/{puuid}`` is a different method than ``/riot/account/v1/accounts/by-riot-id/{gameName}/{tagLine}``\n**Service Rate Limits/Other Limits**\nThese are limits that are set by riot for their services. You have no control over these limits. You will get a ``X-Rate-Limit-Type: service``for service limits and no ``X-Rate-Limit-Type`` header in the response for other rate limits. They both normally reset quickly and you usually can just retry the request and it will be successful. These will not have a ``Retry-After`` header meaning you cannot know when they will resolve.",
